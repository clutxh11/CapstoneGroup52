## 1. Introduction & Need Identification (20%)

### Background & Motivation

Wheelchair basketball is a dynamic, competitive sport that demands exceptional coordination and skill. However, current wheelchair designs create a fundamental limitation: players must use their hands for both propulsion and ball handling, creating a significant competitive disadvantage.

### The Problem

In wheelchair basketball, players face a critical challenge:

- **Hands are required for wheelchair propulsion** - pushing wheels to move
- **Hands are simultaneously needed for ball handling** - dribbling, passing, shooting
- **This dual requirement creates a competitive disadvantage** - players cannot perform basketball skills while moving

### Need Statement

**There is a need for a hands-free mobility system for sports wheelchairs that allows players to control movement through body shifts, freeing up their arms for essential gameplay tasks.**

### Impact & Significance

[TEAM INPUT NEEDED: Samuel]

- Wheelchair basketball participation statistics
- Competitive advantage quantification
- Player testimonials or user stories
- Market research on adaptive sports equipment
