# Omni-Directional Chair Project Plan

This document outlines the initial phases of the Omni-Directional Chair project, with key activities and dates aligned with the Fall 2025 MTE 481 course schedule and the Preliminary Design Presentation (PDP) rubric.

---

## Phase 1: Research & Conceptualization üßê

**Goal:** To define the project scope, understand the underlying technology, and solidify a clear plan of action.

### Timeline (September)

#### September 8 - September 14: Finalize Team Membership

- Register your group on LEARN and finalize your team of 4-5 members
- Begin preliminary discussions about potential project ideas

#### September 15 - September 21: State a Design Problem

Formulate a high-level, solution-neutral problem statement and create a need statement that clearly articulates the real-world need that your mechatronics solution will address.

**Your Solution:**

- **Problem Statement:** In wheelchair basketball, players must use their hands to both propel their chairs and handle the ball, which creates a competitive disadvantage and limits their ability to simultaneously dribble, pass, and shoot while moving.
- **Need Statement:** There is a need for a hands-free mobility system for sports wheelchairs that allows players to control movement through body shifts, freeing up their arms for essential gameplay tasks.

#### September 22 - September 28: Define Specifications

Specify what it means to solve the problem by formulating constraints (pass/fail limits) and criteria (measurable variables for judgment) that any solution must satisfy.

**Constraints:**

- The design must withstand high-impact collisions and resist tipping over during aggressive gameplay
- The chair must be able to withstand lateral disturbances and maintain balance
- The omnidirectional ball mechanism must be able to handle dust and debris from the court without a loss of function

**Criteria:**

- **Speed:** The top speed should be comparable to or faster than a traditional wheelchair basketball chair (e.g., capable of reaching 5 mph)
- **Turning Radius:** The chair should be able to rotate 360 degrees on its own axis
- **Response Time:** The system should respond to a lean or a change in a body position within 100ms
- **Efficiency:** The design should optimize for a battery life of at least two hours of continuous use
- **Component Height:** The components should fit under the seat to avoid making the chair too tall
- **Component Width:** Components should fit under a certain width and not stick out too far from the ball
- **Stability:** Handle bars on the side and leg rest in the front

#### September 29 - October 5 (No meeting): Generate & Research Ideas

- Outline at least four alternative solutions that could address the problem
- Conduct a patent search to find at least three relevant patents or existing solutions, and analyze how they may affect your design

**Milestone:** _Project Proposal Approval_ - This is achieved by completing the above steps and will be presented at your weekly meetings with your supervisors. You will also submit your design log (website) link by September 14.

## Phase 2: Design & Simulation üíª

**Goal:** To translate your conceptual ideas into a detailed digital blueprint and verify the design before physical construction.

### Timeline (October - November)

#### October 6 - October 19: Preliminary Design & Component Selection

**3D CAD Modeling** _(Ameen, assisted by Joseph)_

- Create a 3D CAD model of the chair's frame, the cradle that holds the omnidirectional ball, and all motor mounts
- This is crucial for having designs ready for the PDP

**Design Selection:**

- Apply your criteria to select the best solution for a preliminary design
- **Decision Matrix:** Justify your decision using a decision matrix to compare the relative merits and demerits of your alternatives

**Component Selection** _(Chanuth, assisted by Adesh)_

- Begin the process of Component Selection
- Research and select the microcontroller, high-torque brushless DC motors, IMU, and encoders

#### October 20 - October 26: Preliminary Design Presentation (PDP)

- Present your work from the last six weeks, including your problem, constraints, criteria, alternate solutions, patent review, and your chosen preliminary design with your initial CAD work
- **Due:** The presentation file is due on LEARN by 8:30 AM on October 20

#### October 27 - November 2 (No meeting): Refine the Preliminary Design

- Finalize your component selection, including the power system
- Begin developing a mathematical model of your control system (e.g., using MATLAB/Simulink)

#### November 3 - November 9: Continue Detailed Design

**Control System Simulation** _(Joseph, assisted by Adesh)_

- Develop a mathematical model of your control system (e.g., using MATLAB/Simulink) and begin Control System Simulation to test your self-balancing algorithm
- Refine the design until it is composed of straightforwardly implementable mechanical and electronic elements

#### November 10 - November 16: Design Verification

- Verify that your design meets all specifications and constraints through engineering analysis, simulation results, or preliminary prototyping of key sub-systems

**Milestone:** _Preliminary Design Presentation (PDP)_

---

## Phase 3: Fabrication & Assembly üõ†Ô∏è

**Goal:** To build the physical prototype, assemble the mechanical and electronic sub-systems, and prepare for the final presentation.

### Timeline (November - December)

#### November 17 - November 23 (No meeting): Finalize & Procure

- Finalize your design, making revisions based on your verification work
- Begin Parts Procurement, ordering all electronic components, materials, and custom-fabricated parts
- Start the fabrication of the main chair frame and the omnidirectional ball mechanism

#### November 24 - November 30: Final Design Presentation (FDP)

- Assemble and test each sub-system independently (e.g., motor-encoder assembly, battery pack)
- Present your final design, review your solution method, and explain how you verified it
- **Due:** The presentation file is due on LEARN by 8:30 AM on November 24

#### December 1 - December 7: Final Design Report

- Complete your final project report, including detailed drawings, circuits, graphs, and a material and component selection assessment
- **Due:** The Final Design Report is due on LEARN by the end of day on December 2

**Milestone:** _Final Design Presentation (FDP)_
