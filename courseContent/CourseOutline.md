## Course Description

### Calendar Description for MTE 481

This course is intended to reinforce the concepts learned in MTE380 and to extend the significant design experience obtained. Students work individually or in small groups applying the principles of engineering design and problem-solving to a design project of their own choosing. The project must incorporate all elements of mechatronics, namely, mechanical design, electronics, computers and software. In exceptional circumstances, one or more elements may be exempted by the course instructor. The students are required to consider a need analysis, search for prior art and present alternate designs. The course ends with the selection of a final design. Projects are selected, approved, monitored, and marked by a course co-ordinator.

## Tentative Class Plan

All groups will have short, 15 minute weekly meetings with one pair of instructors to provide status updates and stay on track. Each group will report progress in a design log, which is a website created by the group and updated throughout the term.

The following is an outline of the meeting schedule. In the first meeting on September 4 we will go over details of forming and registering groups along with expectations for the project.

| Date (Week of) | Activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Key Points

- All course components will be completed in **groups of three to five (ideally four)**. Teamwork is essential for successful completion of the course!

- The **Capstone Enrichment** Activity will be held in the Ideas Clinic, and has been introduced across the Faculty of Engineering. We are planning to arrange a session on the Engineering Machine Shop that will help in understanding the capabilities and constraints. Each group will submit a reflection, worth 2% of the final grade.

- The **Risk Assessment Component** will be used to ensure that the team has a plan in place to identify and mitigate and safety risks and hazards. This will also ensure there are no surprises for teams that need a safety inspection prior to the symposium.

---

## Late / Missed Content

### Presentations (PDP and FDP)

The Preliminary and Final Design Presentations (PDP and FDP) are mandatory and will be held in-person on the scheduled dates.

- A student must inform the instructors via email as soon as possible if they will not be present due to a declared absence (see the [policy on declaring absences](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/undergraduate-students/getting-support/declaring-absences)). In this case, the remaining group members will present on their behalf and no penalty will be assessed to the absent student.

- Students that miss a presentation without a valid declared absence will receive a grade of 0% for that component.

### Final Report

The final report is due on the date and time specified on the course LEARN page.

- Late submissions will be penalized 1% of the total possible mark for each hour (or part thereof) they are late.

- Submissions will not be accepted more than 72 hours (3 days) after the deadline.

- Extensions will be granted by the instruction team only in exceptional and documented circumstances and must be requested and approved prior to the deadline.

## Generative AI

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, **may be used** for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. [Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library.](https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai)

Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases.

To protect the privacy and security of any data entered, students should use the University's version of [Co-Pilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) and login with their UW ID. Data entered into other systems can be added to training sets, monitored, geolocated and even reproduced as output which may share private personal information or result in intellectual property breaches.

In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. [More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee.](https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence)

You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. You should be able to readily demonstrate your knowledge of your submissions. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including sources, research notes, brainstorming, drafting notes and prompts. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of your work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document.

We are all expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive teaching- learning environment. Any member of the campus community who has experienced discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the [Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion & Anti-racism (EDI-R)](https://uwaterloo.ca/equity-diversity-inclusion-anti-racism/) via email at equity@uwaterloo.ca. [Sexual Violence Prevention & Response Office (SVPRO)](https://uwaterloo.ca/sexual-violence-prevention-response-office), supports students at UWaterloo who have experienced, or have been impacted by, sexual violence and gender-based violence. This includes those who experienced harm, those who are supporting others who experienced harm. SVPRO can be contacted at svpro@uwaterloo.ca

**Religious & Spiritual Observances:** The University of Waterloo has a duty to accommodate religious and spiritual observances under the Ontario Human Rights Code. Please inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments. Consult with your instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought.

**Respectful Communication and Pronouns:** Communications with Instructor(s) and teaching assistants (TAs) should be through recommended channels for the course (e.g., email, LEARN, Piazza, Teams, etc.) Please use your UWaterloo email address. Include an academic signature with your full name, program, student ID. We encourage you to include your pronouns to facilitate respectful communication (e.g., he/him; she/her; they/them). You can update your chosen/preferred name at [WatIAM](https://idm.uwaterloo.ca/watiam/). You can update your pronouns in [Quest](https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/view-or-update-my-personal-information).

**Mental Health and Wellbeing Resources:** If you are facing challenges impacting one or more courses, contact your academic advisor, Associate Chair Undergraduate, or the Director of your academic program. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. We encourage you to seek out mental health and wellbeing support when needed. The [Faculty of Engineering Wellness Program](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering-wellness-program/) has programming and resources for undergraduate students.

Counselling Services is an inclusive, non-judgmental, and confidential space for anyone to seek support. They offer confidential counselling for a variety of areas including anxiety, stress management, depression, grief, substance use, sexuality, relationship issues, and much more.

**Intellectual Property:** Be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:

- Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof).
- Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides).
- Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and
- Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).

Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student's educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner's permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).

Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity.

Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.

**Continuity Plan - Fair Contingencies for Unforeseen Circumstances:** In the event of emergencies or highly unusual circumstances, the instructor will collaborate with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. This may include modifying content delivery, course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.

**Declaring absences:** Regardless of the process used to [declare an absence](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/undergraduate-students/getting-support/declaring-absences), students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated. Self-declared absences are submitted through [Quest](https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/help/students/how-do-i/self-declare-absence-undergraduate-students). Requests for absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are submitted on the [Absence Database](https://vif.uwaterloo.ca/). The [UWaterloo Verification of Illness form](https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/student-medical-clinic/verification-illness-services), completed by a health professional, is the preferred documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send medical documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Once approved, your instructor will be notified of your absence.

**Rescheduling Co-op Interviews:** Follow the co-op process for [rescheduling co-op interviews](https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/find-your-co-op-job/find-job-waterlooworks/interview/interview-conflicts) for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g., midterms, tests, and final exams). Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.

**Accreditation Data Collection:** The Faculty of Engineering may be collecting information from this course for accreditation purposes, including course outline, exams, assignments, and samples of student work. The [Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB)](https://engineerscanada.ca/accreditation/accreditation-board) periodically reviews the Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) and the Bachelor of Software Engineering (BSE) degrees.

A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to [Policy 72, Student Appeals](https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72).

**Note for students with disabilities and disabling conditions:** The University of Waterloo recognizes its obligations under the Ontario Human Rights Code to accommodate students with known or suspected disabilities and disabling conditions (e.g. medical conditions, injuries, impacts of trauma such as from violence or discrimination) to the point of undue hardship. To support this obligation, [AccessAbility Services](https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/) (AAS) collaborates with all academic departments and schools to facilitate academic accommodations for students with disabilities and disabling conditions without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you believe you may require academic accommodations (e.g., testing accommodations, classroom accommodations), register with AAS as early in the term as possible by completing the [online application](https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/students/applying-academic-accommodations/documentation-information-forms). Students already registered with AAS must activate their accommodations for each of their courses at the beginning of each term using AAS' online system. If you require assistance, contact AAS by phone (519-888-4567 ext. 35082), email (access@uwaterloo.ca) or in-person (Needles Hall North, 1st Floor, Room 1401).

**Turnitin.com:** Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.

It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.
